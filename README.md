# presidential_elections_cvk_open_data
The data of presidential elections candidates` funds is stored xml-files, published on the web-site of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine.
These files are impossible to read via MS Excel or Libre Office Calc, therefore, I suggest the solution with Python in order to convert data from xml-tree to tabular format
